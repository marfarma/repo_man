<h3>The Repo Code</h3>

<p>"'I shall not cause harm to any repository nor the source code contents thereof, nor through inaction let that repository or the source code contents thereof come to harm.' It's what I call the Repo Code, kid. Don't forget it. Etch it in your brain. Not many people got a code to live by anymore."</p>

<p><strong>Translation:</strong> Please do not delete repositories other people are still using. Thank you, and good night.</p>
